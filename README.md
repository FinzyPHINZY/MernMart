## Why I Built This

I built MernMart to showcase my full-stack development skills, particularly in creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using the MERN stack. This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Develop and integrate a full-stack application from scratch
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Manage state efficiently with useContext API
- Design and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces with React and Bootstrap
- Work with RESTful APIs and manage data using MongoDB

## Optimizations

This was built as an attempt to practice using react with the useContext API which was a wonderful experience. I was able to get it to work. I would love to add authentication, maintaining user sessions and other nice features but my main focus for this was just to utilize the useContext API.
