## Why I Built This

I built MernMart to showcase my full-stack development skills, particularly in creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using the MERN stack. This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Develop and integrate a full-stack application from scratch
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Manage state efficiently with Redux
- Design and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces with React and Bootstrap
- Work with RESTful APIs and manage data using MongoDB

## Optimizations

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
